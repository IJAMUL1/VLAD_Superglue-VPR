## Visual Place Recognition using VLAD
This project implements a Visual Place Recognition (VPR) system utilizing VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors), a popular method in computer vision for image retrieval and similarity search. The system enables querying a database of images to find exact matches of query images.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust VPR system capable of accurately identifying target locations and providing localization information. This system can be instrumental in various applications such as loop closure for robots, navigation, and scene understanding.

## Key Features
SuperPoint and SuperGlue Models: The system leverages the SuperPoint and SuperGlue models for feature extraction and matching, facilitating robust image description and comparison.
VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors): VLAD is used to aggregate local feature descriptors into a compact representation, enabling efficient and effective image retrieval.
K-Means Clustering: K-Means clustering is employed to create a codebook for VLAD encoding, enhancing the discriminative power of the feature representation.
BallTree for Nearest Neighbor Search: A BallTree structure is constructed to efficiently search for the closest images in the database based on the query image's VLAD representation.

## Usage

# Setup: 
Ensure that all required dependencies, including PyTorch, OpenCV, tqdm, and scikit-learn, are installed. Also, download the pre-trained SuperPoint and SuperGlue models.
Database Preparation: Organize the database of images that will be used for retrieval. Each image should represent a unique location or scene.
Feature Extraction and VLAD Encoding: Run the provided script to extract feature descriptors from the database images, perform K-Means clustering to obtain a codebook, and compute VLAD representations for each image.
# Querying: 
Provide query images to the system. The system will find the closest matches in the database based on the query image's features and VLAD representation.
Results
The effectiveness of the VPR system can be evaluated based on its accuracy in retrieving relevant images from the database given a query image. Additionally, the system's efficiency in terms of processing time and memory usage can be assessed to ensure real-time performance.

## Future Improvements
Incorporate more advanced feature extraction and matching techniques to enhance the system's performance in challenging scenarios.
Explore alternative encoding methods and clustering algorithms to further improve VLAD representation and retrieval accuracy.
Optimize the system for deployment on resource-constrained devices, enabling practical applications in robotics and other domains.
